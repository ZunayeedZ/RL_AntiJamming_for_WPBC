# RL_AntiJamming_for_WPBC
In this project, we proposed an idea to design a multichannel wireless-powered backscatter communication system that will exploit jamming signals to power low-energy backscatter devices. The primary research problem is categorized into two folds: decide which channel to use for communication between the tag and the reader and decide which tag operation mode to choose. We have tried a reinforcement learning approach to solve this problem. Considering the presence of adversarial signals, we have used an off-policy, model-free Q-learning algorithm. We focused on optimizing the throughput performance under three different jamming strategies. As such, we considered two learning agents, the Access Point (AP) and the Backscatter Device (BD), each having independent learning goals. Finally, our results demonstrate that the proposed method yields near-optimal performance.
